 <h3>Earthquake</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Earthquake is one of the most devastating natural disaster which destroys millions of properties and threaten human life. It is a sudden and violent shaking of earth surface leading to distortion of the ground. The seismic waves generated from it cause the ground to shake, which results into collapse of buildings and infrastructure. The collapse of these structures which are made from heavy material causes many deaths. </div>

  <h3>Fires</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Major source of damage after earthquakes are fires. Earthquakes can easily rupture natural gas mains and water mains, both contributing to the ignition of fires and hindering the efforts to control them. Most of the damage in 1906, San Francisco earthquake was caused by massive fires in the downtown area of the city. Around 25,000 buildings were destroyed by those fires, which were fueled by broken pipelines. In Japan, the Great Kanto earthquake caused a fire that killed around 92,000 people. Overall, more than 2.3 million people have died in 2,233 earthquakes from 1900 </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Flood</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Flood is one of the deadliest types of natural disaster which results from extreme rain, snow, storm surges and coastal storms. It causes outrages, disrupt transportation, damage buildings and create landslides. The main damage is caused due to the impact of rapid moving waters to the buildings. Flooding pushes the sides of the buildings, weakening the building’s structure and at times separating it from foundation. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the USA. In 2015 alone, flooding caused massive devastation in Texas and neighboring states; countless homes and buildings were damaged or destroyed. The chart below shows the number of lives lost due to floods in the U.S. since 1995.  </p>

  <h3>Volcanoes</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Volcanoes are the vents or fissure in the earth crusts where lava, ash, rock and steam erupt on the earth’s surface. The fast-moving lava can destroy houses, buildings, roads and fields. Volcanic eruptions cause damage hundreds of miles away. The ash carpets the ground, burying everything and sometimes even causes buildings to collapse.</p>

  <h3>Hurricane</h3>
  <div>
    <p>A Hurricane is a large rotating storm with high velocity winds that forms over warm waters in tropical areas. The shear strength of hurricanes winds can destroy buildings, topple trees and damage infrastructure. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey first made destruction on San Jose Island, Texas with wind speed of 130 miles per hour. Then hit mainland Texas where it destroyed and damaged more than three hundred thousand structures</p>
